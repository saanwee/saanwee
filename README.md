# Hey there, I'm Saanvi 👋

## 🚀 About Me

I’m a senior at UNC Chapel Hill, double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics with a minor in Data Science, and I am currently looking for full time roles. My academic and professional work sits at the intersection of software development, data engineering, and security, where I enjoy building systems that are both technically rigorous and socially meaningful. 

I have experience working across the stack, with strong foundations in Python, Java, C/C++, and low-level systems, and hands-on exposure to areas like cybersecurity, machine learning, and symbolic analysis. Through internships and research roles, I’ve worked on problems that taught me how to translate complex data into actionable insights. 

Beyond engineering, I’m deeply interested in how technology interacts with law, policy, and social good. I pursue this interest through leadership, volunteering, and writing on my blog!
