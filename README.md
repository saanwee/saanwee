| I am a passionate developer studying computer science and mathematics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My journey into tech started with a fascination for how systems work and has evolved into building ML-powered applications and researching hardware security. I've worked on everything from threat intelligence systems analyzing cyber risk propagation to real-time yoga pose estimators using computer vision. Currently, I'm optimizing symbolic execution engines for hardware security at UNC's Hardware Security Lab and building a RAG-based chatbot using LangChain and Pinecone. I'm driven by the challenge of solving complex problems at the intersection of security, machine learning, and systems. If you're passionate about building impactful tech, let's connect. | |

- 🔭 I'm currently working on hardware security research (SYLQ optimization) and building ML applications
- 🌱 I'm currently learning about compilers, cryptography, and advanced numerical analysis
- 🤔 I'm looking for opportunities to collaborate on ML/security projects and innovative startups
